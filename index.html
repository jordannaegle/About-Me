        <h2>Here is a Haiku</h2>
        <p class="haiku">
        Dedicated to Yerba Mat√©<br>
        Up in the Morning<br>
        Pouring the water to boil<br>
        Caffeine you give me<br>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>About a year ago my parents bought a boat. 
        I started teaching myself how to wake surf and it has become one of my favorite hobbies. 
        Wake surfing in my opinion is a lot easier than wakeboarding because it doesn't tire you 
        out so fast giving you more time to enjoy it. </p>
        <p>I am a big fan of a South American tea called Yerba Mate. 
        I make the tea just about every day and it's one of my favorite 
        morning routines. The tea has natural caffeine in it so 
        it's a great way to wake yourself up. </p>
        <p>I also really enjoy spending time with my family. 
        I am the fourth kid of nine so we make a big group. 
        As all my siblings have gotten older, we've become 
        really close over the years and hanging out for 
        Sunday dinners is always a lot of fun. <p>
